OUR BACKGROUND
We're a team of highly motivated students from Engineering Physics and Electrical Engineering. We all are sophies and have completed various projects ranging from XLR8 and ITSP to RC Plane and Boeing Aeromodelling Competition.
Our project got the 2nd prize in RC plane competition and we were chosen in the best 3 teams for ITSP too.

WHY WE CHOSE THIS PROJECT?
This project has a lot of scope for creativity and innovation and we believe we can come up with something novel and marvellous. Our basic objective for the project is to make a highly integrated sensor for capturing the fluid movements of the hand as perfectly as possible. We will take meticulous care to design a sensor that is comfortable to put on and resistant to physical or environmental damage.

DETAILED IDEA:
We wish to integrate a central microprocessor in the glove which stores the current state of various DOF's we're measuring and exports 
the requested ones so that it's compatible with any kind of gesture-controlled device - be it a simple gripper or a drone or an XR accessory.
We have already done a bit of research to get the idea what this project entails. You can see our GitHub repository here:
